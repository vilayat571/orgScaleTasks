Thanks for considering me for the next steps of the Frontend Engineer role at your company.

I started working on the assigned tasks immediately after receiving your email with the task details on January 13, 2026, at 11:11 AM.

I completed all tasks within approximately 7 hours, broken down as follows: 15 minutes for understanding the requirements, 6 hours for implementation, and 45 minutes for revision and presentation, 
finishing around 9:00 PM. During this process, I used multiple tools and online resources to improve productivity and efficiency.


Task 1:
You asked me to write three different functions to calculate the sum of numbers from 0 to a given natural number n.
It took me less than 5 minutes to complete the first two solutions.

The first solution uses a recursive approach, and the second uses a loop-based approach (either while or for). For the third solution, I needed to do some research, as I initially could not find another 
conventional method. I then approached it conceptually as a shopping cart containing multiple items and implemented it using an array-based method to calculate the total.

Overall, this task took me about 15 minutes, plus an additional 5 minutes for revisions, for a total of approximately 20 minutes to complete all three solutions (including the third approach, if it is accepted as a 
valid solution).


Task 2:
You assigned me a task to develop a Currency Swap Form for money exchange. Honestly, this task was more challenging than the first one. I began by doing some research and taking inspiration from Dribbble, Nicepage, 
and TemplateMonster, which is my usual process when starting a design-focused project.

I then created a Figma design over approximately 1 hour, using plugins such as HTML to Figma to extract base components from inspired designs and from my previous projects. And then…
